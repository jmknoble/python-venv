An opinionated but flexible Python virtual environment tool.

Enables straightforward creation, removal, or replacement of Python virtual
environments using either [venv][] or [conda][], using predictable
names/locations and flexible strategies.

Intended to be used by either developers or consumers of source-available
Python packages.

## Requirements

- A [Python](https://www.python.org/) interpreter, version 3.7 or later
- The Python packages listed in **requirements.txt**


## Installation

The recommended method of installing **python-venv** is to install it into a
virtual environment.  Currently only installation from source is supported,
(unless you build your own packages using `python3 setup.py bdist_wheel`).

**python-venv** can create the virtual environment and install itself for you.
For a [venv][] environment:

    python3 -m python_venv create -t venv -r wheel --dry-run

**python-venv** will say what it would do.  To actually do it, remove the
`--dry-run` argument:

    python3 -m python_venv create -t venv -r wheel

For a [conda][] environment:

    python3 -m python_venv create -t conda -r wheel --dry-run

and to actually do it:

    python3 -m python_venv create -t conda -r wheel


## Invocation

**python-venv** may be invoked in a few different ways:

- Before installation, using the executable script in the top of the source
  directory:

        ./python-venv

- After installation into a Python virtual environment and activation of that
  environment, using the executable script:

        python-venv

- Using the Python interpreter, either from the source directory or from an
  activated virtual enviroment where **python-venv** has been installed:

        python3 -m python_venv

Some of the above methods may differ for some command-line interpreters on
Windows.

For the remainder of this document, we will use `python-venv` to mean any of
the above methods.


## Quick Start

Create a Python virtual environment using [venv][] at `.venv` for the Python
project in the current directory, using `requirements.txt` as the list of
requirements:

    python-venv create -t venv -r plain

Remove that virtual enviroment:

    python-venv remove -t venv

Create a [conda][] virtual environment nameed after the Python project in the
current directory using `requirements.txt`:

    python-venv create -t conda -r plain

Remove that [conda][] environment:

    python-venv remove -t conda -r plain

Display command-line help:

    python-venv --help


## Types of Virtual Environments

**python-venv** knows how to create virtual environments using:

- The [venv][] module built into Python 3.
- The [conda][] tool that accompanies a [Miniconda][] or [Anaconda][] Python
  distribution.

Use the `-t` or `--env-type` option to say what type of virtual environment to
create or remove.


## Installing Requirements

**python-env** understands several different opinionated ways of specifying
what to install into a virtual environment:

- **Plain** -- using a `requirements.txt` file.
- **Frozen** -- using frozen requirements (from `pip freeze`) in a
  `requirements_frozen.txt` file.
- **Package** -- using the name of the Python project in the current directory
  as a package to `pip install`.
- **Source** -- using the Python project in the current directory as a thing
  to install via `python3 setup.py install`.
- **Wheel** -- using the Python project in the current directory as a thing
  to build via `python3 setup.py bdist_wheel` and then installing the result.
- **Dev** -- using a combination of requirements files to install packages as
  a development environment for the Python project in the current directory.

These methods correspond roughly to the following:

| Kind of Requirements | Corresponding Install Command |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| plain | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| frozen | `pip install -r requirements_frozen.txt` |
| package | `pip install this-package-name` |
| source | `python3 setup.py install` |
| wheel | `python3 setup.py bdist_wheel; pip install WHEELFILE` |
| dev | `pip install -r requirements.txt -r dev/requirements_build.txt -r dev/requirements_dev.txt -r dev/requirements_test.txt` |


### Opinionation and Development Environments

**python-venv** creates `dev` environments from the following requirements
files that correspond to arguments of the `setup()` call in `setup.py`:

| Requirements | `setup()` argument | Purpose |
|--------------|--------------------|---------|
| requirements.txt | `install_requires` | Runtime requirements |
| dev/requirements_dev.txt | `setup_requires` | Requirements for developing |
| dev/requirements_test.txt | `tests_require` | Requirements for running tests |
| dev/requirements_build.txt | _None_ | Requirements for building packages |

This is the scheme followed by **python-venv**'s `setup.py`.  It's quite
likely it may not work well for everyone.


### Names and Some Flexibility

Part of **python-venv**'s purpose in life is to create or re-create Python
environments in a predictable way using a single command.

The default "base name" comes from the Python project in the current directory
(`python3 setup.py --name`), with underscores replaced by hyphens (that is,
`python-venv` for this Python project).

This base name is used for:

- The name of non-`dev` [conda][] environments as-is.
- The name of `dev` [conda][] environments with a `-dev` suffix
  (`python-venv-dev`).
- The name of the Python package to install for `package` environments.

You can choose your own base name using the `--basename` option; this will
keep **python-env** from trying to use `setup.py` to find the name:

    python-venv create -t conda -r dev --basename python-venv-0.1.0
    python-venv create -t venv -r package --basename mypackage

You can also choose your own environment name using the `--env-name` option if
you want a different environment name:

    python-venv create -t conda -r plain --env-name myenv

Or, if you are using `venv` environments, if you want your virtual environment
somewhere besides `.venv`:

    python-venv create -t venv -r plain --env-name ~/.venvs/myenv


## Command-line Autocompletion

**python-venv** provides command-line [autocompletion][] for the [Bash][]
command-line shell and compatible shells, using the
[argcomplete][argcomplete-pypi] Python package.

For instructions on how to enable completion:

    python-venv completion
