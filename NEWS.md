## v0.7.x

- Add support for creating environments by building and installing
  a wheelfile (`-r wheel`) as a preferred alternative to `-r source`.
- Change in `-r dev` to make it more generic; now it expects dev requirements
  to simply be in `requirements_dev.txt`.
- Previous opinionated `-r dev` functionality is available as `-r devplus`.


## v0.6.x

- Improve and encapsulate requirements handling logic.


## v0.5.x

- Add `--python-version` argument for conda environments to choose Python
  version.


## v0.4.x

- Significantly increase unit test coverage.

## v0.3.x

- Split code that handles requirements processing away from environment
  creation.
- Add unit tests.


## v0.2.x

- Add `replace` subcommand in lieu of using `remove` and then `create`.
- Improve conda environment support.
