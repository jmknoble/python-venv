# TODO

## Code

This code is inelegant; it used to be a single script included with other
source and suffers from that.

- DONE ~Command-line completion with `argcomplete`.~
- DONE ~Split virtual environment "smarts" into separate module(s), preferably using
  an abstract base class and derived concrete classes to implement.~
- DONE ~Possibly split requirements handling into its own module.~
- Clean up the CLI argument parsing.
- DONE (but no prompting) ~Add `replace` command (`create --force`, with prompting).~
- DONE ~Write unit tests.~
